<h1>Password Strength Checker</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, we will be building a Python script designed to assess the strength of passwords. The goal is to develop a tool that evaluates user passwords based on criteria such as length, the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and their commonality against a database of frequently used passwords. This exercise serves as a fundamental lesson in understanding the robustness of passwords and the importance of creating secure, hard-to-crack credentials. <br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali Linux</b> 

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

- <b>Development and Enhancement of Python Scripting Skills</b>: Successfully developed a Python script designed to evaluate the strength of passwords based on predefined security criteria. This project showcased the ability to integrate Pythonâ€™s string handling capabilities with file operations, advancing skills in creating practical security tools. Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming by implementing conditional logic and loops to assess various password characteristics effectively.

- <b>Practical Application and Security Awareness</b>: Gained practical experience in implementing security measures within software applications by testing the password strength checker against a comprehensive list of commonly used passwords. This process emphasized the critical role of strong password policies in protecting user data and reinforced the importance of avoiding common passwords, which are susceptible to brute-force attacks and other cracking methods.

- <b>Understanding of Password Security Best Practices</b>: Through the development of this tool, reinforced the best practices for creating strong, unguessable passwords that enhance security. This project highlighted the balance between user convenience and the necessity for rigorous security measures in password management.
